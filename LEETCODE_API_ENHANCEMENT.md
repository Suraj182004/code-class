# üöÄ LeetCode API Enhancement: Solving the 20-Submission Limit

## üìã Problem Analysis

### The Issue
The current LeetCode submission checking service was limited to discovering only **~20 recently accepted solutions** despite users having solved significantly more problems. For example:
- User profile shows: **32 problems solved**
- API returns: **19-20 recent submissions**
- **Gap: 13 problems (40.6%) not discoverable**

### Root Cause
LeetCode's `recentAcSubmissionList` GraphQL endpoint has a **hard-coded limit of ~20 submissions** regardless of the `limit` parameter value. This is an intentional API restriction by LeetCode.

## üîç Research & Investigation

### API Testing Results
Through comprehensive testing, we discovered:

1. **`recentAcSubmissionList`**: Hard-limited to 20 submissions
   ```graphql
   query recentAcSubmissionList($username: String!, $limit: Int!) {
     recentAcSubmissionList(username: $username, limit: $limit) {
       titleSlug
       timestamp
     }
   }
   ```
   - ‚ùå Setting `limit: 2000` still returns only ~20 submissions
   - ‚ùå Multiple calls with different parameters yield same results

2. **`problemsetQuestionList`**: Requires authentication for user-specific status
   ```graphql
   query problemsetQuestionList($filters: QuestionListFilterInput) {
     problemsetQuestionList: questionList(filters: $filters) {
       questions: data {
         status  # Only available with authentication
         titleSlug
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - ‚ùå Without authentication, `status` field is always null

3. **User Profile Stats**: Provides total count but not problem list
   ```graphql
   query userProfileStats($username: String!) {
     matchedUser(username: $username) {
       submitStatsGlobal {
         acSubmissionNum {
           difficulty
           count  # Total solved count available ‚úÖ
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Can get total solved count
   - ‚ùå Cannot get list of solved problems

## üí° Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Discovery Service

**File**: `server/src/services/submission.service.ts`

#### Key Functions Added:

**`getLeetCodeUserStats(username)`**
- Fetches user's total solved count and breakdown by difficulty
- Provides ground truth for validation

**`getAllLeetCodeSolvedSlugsEnhanced(username)`**
- Combines multiple discovery strategies
- Implements progressive discovery with multiple API calls
- Provides detailed coverage reporting

**`progressiveLeetCodeDiscovery(username)`**
- Attempts multiple API calls with different parameters
- Rate-limited to respect API constraints
- Maximizes discovery within API limitations

### 2. Smart Caching System

**Ultimate Solution**: `getLeetCodeSolvedSlugsWithCaching(username)`

#### Features:
- **Historical Accumulation**: Never loses discovered data
- **Smart Updates**: Updates only when needed (hourly or when user solves more)
- **Coverage Tracking**: Monitors discovery success rates
- **Adaptive Frequency**: Reduces checks for inactive users
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging

#### Cache Structure:
```typescript
{
  allDiscoveredSlugs: Set<string>;      // Accumulated problems
  lastUpdate: Date;                     // Last cache update
  totalSolvedCount: number;             // User's total from profile
  consecutiveEmptyChecks: number;       // Optimization counter
}
```

### 3. Integration with Existing System

Updated `processSubmissionsInBulk` to use the smart caching system:
```typescript
// Before
leetCodeSolved = await getAllLeetCodeSolvedSlugs(user.leetcodeUsername);

// After  
leetCodeSolved = await getLeetCodeSolvedSlugsWithCaching(user.leetcodeUsername);
```

## üìä Performance Results

### Current Implementation Results:
```
Target User: Die_hard-PROGRAmmer
=====================================
LeetCode Profile Total: 32 problems
Original Method: 19 problems (59.4% coverage)
Enhanced Method: 19 problems (59.4% coverage)  
Ultimate Solution: 19 problems (59.4% coverage)

Gap: 13 problems (40.6%) still not discoverable
```

### Why Same Results?
The immediate results are similar because **LeetCode's API limitation is fundamental**. However, the ultimate solution provides:

1. **Progressive Improvement**: Over time, as users solve new problems, more get cached
2. **No Data Loss**: Once discovered, problems are never lost
3. **Reduced API Calls**: Caching prevents repeated API requests
4. **Better Monitoring**: Detailed statistics and coverage tracking

## üéØ Real-World Benefits

### Scenario: Long-term Usage
```
Week 1: Discover 19/32 problems (59.4% coverage)
Week 2: User solves 3 new problems ‚Üí Cache grows to 22/35 (62.9% coverage)  
Week 3: User solves older problems ‚Üí Some gaps filled ‚Üí 25/35 (71.4% coverage)
Week 4: Continued accumulation ‚Üí 28/35 (80% coverage)
```

### Cache Statistics Example:
```json
{
  "totalUsers": 1,
  "users": [{
    "username": "Die_hard-PROGRAmmer", 
    "cachedProblems": 19,
    "totalSolved": 32,
    "coverage": "59.4%",
    "consecutiveEmptyChecks": 0
  }],
  "summary": {
    "avgCoverage": "59.4%",
    "totalCachedProblems": 19
  }
}
```

## üîß Production Recommendations

### 1. Database Persistence
Replace in-memory cache with database storage:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_submission_cache (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  leetcode_username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  discovered_slugs TEXT[], -- Array of problem slugs
  total_solved_count INTEGER,
  last_update TIMESTAMP,
  consecutive_empty_checks INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Background Jobs
Implement periodic cache updates:
```typescript
// Run every 2 hours
cron.schedule('0 */2 * * *', async () => {
  const activeUsers = await getActiveUsers();
  for (const user of activeUsers) {
    await getLeetCodeSolvedSlugsWithCaching(user.leetcodeUsername);
  }
});
```

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard
Track cache performance:
- Coverage percentages by user
- Cache hit rates
- API call frequency
- Discovery trends over time

### 4. Optimization Strategies
- **Adaptive Frequency**: Reduce checks for users with consecutive empty results
- **Batch Processing**: Update multiple users in parallel
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect LeetCode's API limits
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when API fails

## üèÅ Summary

### What We Achieved:
1. ‚úÖ **Identified the root cause**: LeetCode API's 20-submission limit
2. ‚úÖ **Implemented enhanced discovery**: Multiple strategies for maximum coverage
3. ‚úÖ **Built smart caching**: Accumulates data over time without loss
4. ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive monitoring**: Statistics and performance tracking
5. ‚úÖ **Maintained backward compatibility**: Original functions still work

### Current Limitations:
- Initial discovery still limited to ~20 recent problems
- Requires time to build comprehensive cache
- Cannot discover problems solved before system deployment

### Future Improvements:
- Database-backed persistence
- Background job automation  
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with other coding platforms

The solution transforms a **one-time 60% coverage limitation** into a **progressive, accumulating system** that improves over time and never loses discovered data.
