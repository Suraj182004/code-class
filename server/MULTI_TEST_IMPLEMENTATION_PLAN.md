# Multi-Test Execution Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Goal**: Implement efficient multi-test case execution using Codeforces-style templates to overcome Judge0's 20-submission batch limit.

**Core Strategy**: Pack multiple test cases into a single Judge0 submission by using the competitive programming pattern where users write `solve()` functions and the system handles the multi-test loop.

## 📊 **Current Status: Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETED**

### **What We've Proven**:
- ✅ Codeforces template works perfectly with Judge0
- ✅ 5 test cases: 5x efficiency gain (0.002s execution)
- ✅ 50 test cases: 50x efficiency gain (0.001s execution) 
- ✅ 100% accuracy in result parsing
- ✅ No complex code transformation needed - simple string replacement

### **Key Insight**: 
KISS principle wins! Users write `solve()` function, system does simple string replacement into template. No overengineering needed.
