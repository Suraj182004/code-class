# EC2 Judge0 Testing Plan - Production Readiness

## Memory Analysis Summary
- **Jest/TypeScript Tests**: 2GB+ memory usage ❌ (NOT production safe)
- **Pure JS Validation**: 4.14MB memory usage ✅ (Production safe)
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript compilation + AWS SDK imports cause memory bloat

## Testing Strategy: Step-by-Step Validation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation (AWS Setup)
**Goal**: Verify AWS credentials, permissions, and EC2 launch capabilities

```bash
# Test AWS connectivity
npm run test:aws-connection

# Test EC2 permissions 
npm run test:ec2-permissions

# Test VPC/Security Group creation
npm run test:network-setup
```

### Phase 2: EC2 Instance Lifecycle Testing
**Goal**: Validate instance launch, setup, and termination

```bash
# Launch test instance
npm run test:ec2-launch

# Monitor setup progress
npm run test:setup-monitoring

# Validate Judge0 installation
npm run test:judge0-health

# Test graceful shutdown
npm run test:ec2-shutdown
```

### Phase 3: Judge0 Functionality Testing
**Goal**: Verify Judge0 API works correctly on EC2

```bash
# Test basic code execution
npm run test:judge0-execution

# Test batch submissions
npm run test:batch-processing

# Test language support
npm run test:language-validation

# Stress test with 100+ cases
npm run test:stress-execution
```

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
**Goal**: Test full workflow with realistic scenarios

```bash
# Test complete workflow
npm run test:full-workflow

# Test multiple students simulation
npm run test:multi-student

# Test cost tracking
npm run test:cost-monitoring

# Test failure recovery
npm run test:failure-scenarios
```

## Next Steps Priority Order

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ **Fix memory issues** - Use lightweight validators
2. 🔧 **Create AWS connection test** - Verify credentials work
3. 🚀 **Test EC2 launch** - Single instance creation
4. 🏥 **Validate Judge0 setup** - Ensure automation scripts work

### This Week
1. 📊 **Full workflow testing** - End-to-end validation
2. 💰 **Cost tracking validation** - Verify savings calculations
3. 🔄 **Failure recovery testing** - Error handling scenarios
4. 📈 **Performance benchmarking** - Load testing with realistic data

### Before Production
1. 🛡️ **Security audit** - EC2 security groups, IAM roles
2. 📝 **Documentation complete** - Deployment guides
3. 🚨 **Monitoring setup** - CloudWatch, alerts
4. 🎯 **Backup/Recovery plan** - Instance failure scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Fix)
- ❌ **Memory bloat in tests** - Could crash production
- ⚠️ **No real AWS testing yet** - Theoretical implementation only
- ⚠️ **No Judge0 validation** - Scripts untested on real EC2

### Medium Risk (Monitor)
- 📊 **Cost calculation accuracy** - Need real AWS billing validation
- 🔄 **Shutdown timing** - May leave instances running
- 🏥 **Health check reliability** - False positives/negatives

### Low Risk (Acceptable)
- 🎯 **Language support** - Standard Judge0 languages
- 📈 **Batch processing** - Well-tested logic
- 💻 **Core algorithms** - Validated with lightweight tests

## Recommended Testing Sequence

```bash
# 1. Core logic validation (already working)
npm run test:light

# 2. AWS connection test (next step)
npm run test:aws-basic

# 3. EC2 instance creation (following step)  
npm run test:ec2-minimal

# 4. Judge0 setup validation (after EC2 works)
npm run test:judge0-basic

# 5. Full integration test (final step)
npm run test:integration
```

## Memory Optimization for Production

### For Development/Testing
- Use pure JavaScript validators (`npm run test:light`)
- Avoid Jest for integration tests
- Use focused AWS SDK imports only when needed

### For Production Runtime
- No TypeScript compilation overhead
- Optimized AWS SDK usage
- Memory-efficient service architecture
- Proper cleanup and garbage collection

## Success Criteria

✅ **Core Logic**: All mathematical calculations correct  
🔧 **AWS Connectivity**: Credentials and permissions working  
🚀 **EC2 Launch**: Instance creation successful  
🏥 **Judge0 Setup**: Automated installation working  
📊 **Cost Tracking**: Accurate billing calculation  
🎯 **Full Workflow**: End-to-end test passing  

**Ready for production when ALL criteria met** ✅
